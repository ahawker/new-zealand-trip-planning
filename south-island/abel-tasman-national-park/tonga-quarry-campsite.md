# Tonga Quarry Campsite

Walk-in or boat-in to this beachside campsite on the Mosquito Bay to Awaroa section of the Abel Tasman Coast Track. There is no drive on access.

The attractive Tonga Quarry campsite is adjacent to a beach that is more intimate than the larger Bark Bay campsite or even Onetahuti. Thereâ€™s a few artifacts remaining from the days when it was actually a quarry, ie, over 100 years ago, the Nelson Cathedral steps were extracted from here.
