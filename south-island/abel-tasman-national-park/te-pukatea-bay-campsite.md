# Te Pukatea Bay Campsite

Walk-in or boat-in to this beachside campsite on the Tinline to Anchorage section of the Abel Tasman Coast Track. There is no drive on access.

Thereâ€™s a reason Te Pukatea Bay campsite gets booked out early despite the minimal facilities: Te Puketea Bay is one of the most beautiful in the national park, and the campsite is perched in the bush just above it.
