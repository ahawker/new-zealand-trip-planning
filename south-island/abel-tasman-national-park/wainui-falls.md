# Wainui Falls Track

From the carpark the track crosses farmland for a short distance before entering forest and climbing rapidly to a point where you see the river surprisingly far below.

Here you walk through a forest of nikau palms, rata trees and ferns. Keep a lookout for a possible sighting of the giant snail, Powelliphanta. Look but don't touch!

A few minutes after crossing the swing bridge over the Wainui River you will hear the falls before they suddenly appear, usually curtained in spray.

The track starts from a carpark in Wainui Bay, 20 km north-east from Takaka. Look for the direction sign on the road side approximately 300 metres after crossing over the Wainui River Bridge.
