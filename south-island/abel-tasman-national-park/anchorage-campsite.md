# Anchorage Campsite

Walk-in or boat-in to this beachside campsite on the Tinline to Anchorage section of the Abel Tasman Coast Track. There is no drive on access.

Anchorage has great facilities, but is also quite busy. It is especially busy in summer with pick-ups of kayaks and day walkers by water taxis. It is a scheduled water taxi stop.
