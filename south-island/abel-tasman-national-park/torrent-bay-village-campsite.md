# Torrent Bay Village Campsite

Walk-in or boat-in to this campsite on the Torrent Bay Estuary to Bark Bay section of the Abel Tasman Coast Track. There is no drive on access.

Situated beside a tidal estuary, the Torrent Bay Village Campsite is five minutes from a scheduled water taxi stop.

Adjacent to the Torrent Bay estuary which is either tide in, or tide out, this is a no frills campsite close to the Torrent Bay Village, which other than a few baches has few actual village qualities.
